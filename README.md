- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [My new Personal Website](https://github.com/bnorthern42/PersonalWebsiteReact). This is to replace my Wordpress site at [bnorthern.info](https://bnorthern.info/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Development with [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) and how to be a better programmer every day.
- âœ¨ I would like to learn: Angular or Vue, Currently a React with TS fanboy with JHipster 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me: Anything, I like being the jack of all trades, however, I love doing applied cryptography type programming.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Originally Graduated with a Undergraduate Degree in Manufacturing Enginneering, now I'm living the dream of a programmer, solving problems.

Check out my other Repos. If I get enough interest, I will start doing a code with me Saturdays on Twitch, where I work on current Saturday Projects. 

### An Argument for Microservices in Research

Same as functional programming, why re-code the same thing twice. For example, if you make an authentication / registration service, why do it again? If you had all the small problems already solved in services, take those and mix it up to solve the bigger problems. Basically: Faster prototyping to think about the even bigger questions. (Spring Boot has changed the way I think about programming for the web, and I love using it!)
